         <div class="content">Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</div>

        <div class="content">A mountain is a landform that rises high above the surrounding terrain in a limited area. ... Mountains usually have steep, sloping sides and sharp or slightly rounded ridges and peaks. Mountains can be rocky and barren.

        <div class="content">A rainbow is a beautiful natural phenomena that occurs when drops of rainwater meet sunlight. The multi-color arch is produced by a fundamental process called refraction, or the “bending” of light. In optics, refraction is a phenomenon that often occurs when waves travel from a medium with a given refractive index to a medium with another at an oblique angle.</div>
